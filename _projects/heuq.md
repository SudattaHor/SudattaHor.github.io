Equations of state (EOS) are essential in characterizing high
explosives. Estimates of EOS parameters exist, but
are calibrated under the assumption that different shots have the
same resulting optimal parameters. It is still unknown if these
results agree between individual shots. This work aims to
determine if shots of the Pemberton experiment can be used as
one collective result, or if each run should be treated separately.
