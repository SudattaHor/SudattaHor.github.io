# Welcome!

I'm Sudatta, an undergraduate at Brown University (Class of 2024) studying Mathematics-Computer Science and Physics. My research interests include **quantum computing**, **machine learning**, **optimization**, and **cryptography**.

Currently, I'm a teaching assistant for a new applied cryptography course [(link)](https://brownappliedcryptography.github.io/). I'm also conducting quantum computing research and learning more about quantum information, deep learning, numerical optimization, and algebraic graph theory.

Previously, I worked at Los Alamos National Laboratory researching uncertainty quantification in high explosives [(link)]("https://sudattahor.github.io/portfolio/heuq/"). I also conducted fluid dynamics research at the Brown University School of Engineering, where I simulated microbubble oscillations accounting for buckling and rupture of a microbubble shell [(link)](https://github.com/SudattaHor/Rayleigh-Plesset-Solver).
