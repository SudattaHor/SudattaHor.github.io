# Welcome! :wave:

I'm Sudatta, an undergraduate at **Brown University** (Class of 2024) studying Mathematics-Computer Science and Physics. My research interests include
- *quantum computing*,
- *machine learning*,
- *optimization*, and
- *cryptography*.

Currently, I'm a teaching assistant for a new [applied cryptography course](https://brownappliedcryptography.github.io/). I'm also conducting quantum computing research and learning more about *quantum information*, *deep learning*, *numerical optimization*, and *algebraic graph theory*.

Previously, I worked at **Los Alamos National Laboratory** researching [uncertainty quantification in high explosives](https://sudattahor.github.io/portfolio/heuq/). I also conducted fluid dynamics research at the **Brown University School of Engineering**, where I [simulated microbubble oscillations](https://github.com/SudattaHor/Rayleigh-Plesset-Solver) accounting for buckling and rupture of a microbubble shell.
